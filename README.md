# Data-Analysis-Projects

I have made these projects while learning different tools that are required to be successful in the data analysis field. The different tools that I have worked on while creating the projects are Power BI Desktop, Microsoft SQL server, My SQL Database and Microsoft Excel.

I have written many queries in the SQL which were required in order to perform data cleaning and derive useful insights from the data. The .sql folder inside the repositories depicts the queries used inside the project. Thereafter, I have performed Extract-transform-load (ETL) operations on the data in order to prepare visual insights that are created in the Power BI desktop application.
